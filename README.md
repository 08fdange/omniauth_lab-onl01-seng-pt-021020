# Omniauth

## Objectives

We're going to use Omniauth and Rails to make an app that lets you login with Facebook.

## Introduction

Our app will have one page, with a "Login with Facebook" link on it. When the user clicks the link, they'll be asked to authorize our app on Facebook. When they do, they return to the homepage and see all the information about them we could glean from Facebook.
